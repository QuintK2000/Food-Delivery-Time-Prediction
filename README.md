# Food-Delivery-Time-Prediction
Food Delivery Time Prediction by using Random Forest, XGBoost, AdaBoost and Decision Tree Regressors and comparing their results.Investigative work for finding out important features.

Description of Models:

Random Forest Regressor:
  Ensemble method combining multiple decision trees.
  Handles non-linear relationships and feature interactions well.
  Resistant to overfitting.
  Often performs well with tabular data.

XGBoost Regressor:
  Highly efficient implementation of gradient boosted trees.
  Known for superior predictive performance.
  Handles missing values and regularization effectively.
  Capable of capturing complex patterns.

AdaBoost Regressor:
  Sequentially builds trees, focusing on harder-to-predict instances.
  Can improve accuracy for "weaker" learners.
  Less prone to overfitting than some other boosting methods.

Decision Tree Regressor:
  Simple, interpretable model for non-linear relationships.
  Serves as a baseline and potential building block for ensembles.
